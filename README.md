Thesis code 27.5.2019

Here are all the code for my thesis, returned 27.5.2019

There are some implementations that needs to be added for the actual GUI, as well as the analysis.

All the modifications made after the return will be made to these files as well.

The actual project consists of three different sections:
- Arduino code, firmware part
- Raspberry Pi code, GUI part
- Analysis code, run on any PC

A link to the actual thesis will be provided in this project once the thesis is published
